# Retail Sales Prediction and Analysis

## Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning** techniques to predict department-wide sales for each store in the upcoming year. It models the effects of markdowns during holiday weeks to understand their influence on sales. Insights are visualized using **Streamlit**, providing an interactive platform for exploring sales patterns and predictions. The project integrates predictive modeling, causal analysis, and data-driven decision-making for strategic retail optimization.
